Today I gave a presentation about MongoDB to my INFO1103: Introduction to Databases course. Since the course focuses mostly on SQl, I built the presentation within that context. If you want to get started with MongoDB here are a few resources:

- Head over to the MongoDB [Drivers Page](https://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/) to download the resources for your perferred language.
- Learn MongoDB through one of several FREE 7-week courses at [Mongo University](https://university.mongodb.com/courses). There are courses for Node.js, Java, Python, and C#.

- And now that you're able to use MongoDB, browse the [documentation](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/) to hone your skills and become an expert!

I plan to make a video on this topic in the future, but for now you can see the visuals of the presentation below.
