Do you have a dream job? Are you doing what it takes, are putting in the work, to get that job? Are you just waiting for something to happen, a lucky chance perhaps, or a certain level of skill -- you can always do just a little bit more. But you're always going to wish you had started pursuing your dreams sooner. I'm starting now, and I still wish I had started sooner.

In this post, which I'll be adding to over the next few days, I'm going to be developing and documenting a process to (hopefully) get my dream internship in Summer 2016. I hope this post will inspire you to do the same with your dream job. It's out there somewhere; you just have to go get it!

## Starting the Process 

#### 9:07 PM - 25 Dec, 2015

It's Christmas Day, a time to spend with family and close friends, and be giving. I have done all the Christas traditions of gift giving, Christmas Dinner, and visiting with relatives, but now it's time to get back to work! :)

I just finished laying out the initial steps of my process on a [Trello](http://www.trello.com/) Board. This will help break down this task of applying for internships into more managable steps that I can tackle one-by-one. I've also assigned due dates for each of the four tasks to keep myself accountable and on schedule, so I can have this project out of the way before the new year.

## 1. Research Internship 

#### 9:21 - 25 Dec, 2015

This first step is essintial in figuring out what internships exist that fit my critera. What I'm looking for in an internship is a company with an inpiring products, a focus on innovation, and a focus on learning. As a bonus, I want to work with web-based technologies including AngularJS, Node.js, MongoDB, ElasticSearch. Knowing what internships I will be applying for will help me shape my approach to the subsequent steps. I will be applying for internships both locally (in Fredericton), but also abroad.

#### 1:26 AM - 26 Dec, 2015

Well, I finished my research of internships and here are my prospects:

## Companies Abroad

<img class="logo-img" alt="DoorDash Logo" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/post/doordash-logo.jpg" />

### DoorDash [Software Engineer Intern]

[DoorDash](http://doordash.com) is a startup based in San Fransisco, California. Their product is a delivery service for local merchants around the world. Customers can order products via DoorDash and have them delivered within 45 minutes.

An excerpt from their Software Engineer Intern job posting:

```
    Help build out the world's first on-demand, logistics engine for delivery. We're looking for talented engineers to join our team and help us create and maintain a 24x7 no downtime global infrastructure system that powers DoorDash. The right person will be working with cutting edge technologies and amazingly smart people.

    [...]
    
    - Passionate about solving interesting, bleeding-edge engineering problems
    - Excited to develop, release and run large-scale web applications
    - Driven, focused self-starters who take ownership of their work

    [...]
    
    - Has built and launched full stack web products before
    - Familiar with machine learning
    - Experience building large scale, real-time applications

```

[Full Job Posting](https://boards.greenhouse.io/doordash/jobs/41398#.Vn3v6pMrKCQ)

What attrachs me to DoorDash is their passion to build a great platform. From reviewing their website, I got a real sense of innovation from them. The job posting itself excites me because involves problem-solving in engineering and working on large-scale web applications, which are areas in which I want to improve my skills. I have also had experience building full stack web products, so I think I am a good fit for this position. ANd although I am not familiar with machine learning, I would love to get started!

I think that, especiialy for internships, if you can check off all of the qualifying critera, you're over-qualified. An internship should be a learning experience -- not just a means of income. So I like to aim a little higher and apply for jobs just a little bit out of my comfort zone. Of course, I wouldn't apply for jobs that I'm completely unqualified for, that wouldn't make for a positive learning experience, but you also don't want to know absolutly everything. If you do, you're aiming too low.

<img class="logo-img" alt="Tubular Labs Logo" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/post/tubular-logo.svg" />

### Tubular Labs [Software Engineer - Intern]

[Tubular Labs](http://tubularlabs.com/) is based in Mountain View, California and they provide a software platform for online video analytics. Their clients include Comedy Central, Activision, and many more. They are passionate about their work.

Here's the job posting on Tubular's website: [Software Engineer - Intern](https://jobs.lever.co/tubularlabs/169bdf2b-54a0-46f8-8a24-c22d5116930e)

For their Software Engineer - Intern position, they are looking for someone who wants to make an impact on their product and believe in a hands-on approach to learning. I like this job posting because it is flexible. The only critera is having "a desire to learn and build great experiences" and currently be enrolled in a computer scinece-related degree program. What this tell me as an applicant is that they are really focused on making sure their interns have a great experience.

I also love that they are using technologies and languages in which I'm interested: ElasticSearch, AWS, Python, AngularJS, and more! In my mind, this would be the perfect internship for me. It has a great balance between my current skillset what I want to learn.

<img class="logo-img" alt="Dropbox Logo" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/post/dropbox-logo.png" />

### Dropbox [Software Engineer Intern - Summer 2016, Site Reliability Engineer Intern- Summer 2016]

If you haven't heard of [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/) then I don't know where you've been over the past decade. Dropbox was the company that led the charge in cloud-based file storage/syncing. They were then followed by products like iCould Drive, and Google Drive. However, Dropbox offers customizable features and a landscape of third-party plugins which set them apart from their competators. I've always likes the company ever since I started using their product, and so naturally I have a passion for working on Dropbox. I'd love to learn what I can from them through an intership.

Dropbox currently has two internships for Summer 2016 in my field:

- [Software Engineer Intern - Summer 2016](https://www.dropbox.com/jobs/listing/91579)
- [Site Reliability Engineer Intern- Summer 2016](https://www.dropbox.com/jobs/listing/91462)

Personally, I like the first job posting most as it focuses on working with web-based technologies and APIs. What I would like to get out of this internship is a knowledge about the inner workings of the Dropbox product. I think it's just amazing how Dropbox works, and I would hope some of that innovation rubs off on me. ;)

### Lyft [Intern: Software Engineer (Summer 2016)]

Yet another company in the San Fransisco, CA area, [Lift](http://www.lift.com) is company that is similar to Uber. Their product is based on the ridesharing concept, connecting passengers with drivers.

Their [Intern: Software Engineer (Summer 2016)]() position highlights collaborative teamwork, predictive matching algorithms with machine learning, dealing with race conditions in real-time server environments, and a focus on schema-less databases (specifically MongoDB).

This internship seems to offer a similar experience to DoorDash's internship. I think both would be a positive learning experience, especially with the aspect of machine learning.

## Local Companies

I cannot disclose too much about these position because they are only eligible to students enrolled in a university co-op program. There currently is no posting for these jobs but I am anticipating that there will be one in the coming weeks. 

<img class="logo-img" alt="Blue Spurs Logo" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/post/blue-spurs-logo.png" />

### Blue Spurs [Co-op Student]

[Blue Spurs](http://www.bluespurs.com/) is a company based in Fredericton, NB, and they provide a variety of services for custom application development to cloud computing solutions.

I have interviewed with Blue Spurs in the past and, from my interview, I think they would provide great environment for learning a variety of new technologies including AngularJS, ElasticSearch, and more. Their projects are often web and mobile-based, which would fit well with my current skillset.

<img class="logo-img" alt="Cvent Logo" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/post/cvent-logo.png" />

### Cvent [Co-op Student]

[Cvent](http://www.cvent.com) wants to transform the way we schedule and plan meetings and events. Their suite of software products enables clients to plan events with ease.

I became interested in working with Cvent in Fredericton when I met their Director of Product Development, [Brian Dunphy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/briandunphy), and we had an in-depth conversation about UX/UI and frontend development. Sharing a passion for building a great product is what interests me most about this position. Cvent has a great product that I would love to help build, but the real value from working with Cvent would be learning from Brian's experience in the industry through working with his team.

## Other Prospects

I have a few other prospects for internships in Summer 2016, but for several reasons I cannot discuss them here. However, I will still be keeping these in mind in the following steps of my process. When the co-op job bank opens up for Summer 2016 jobs, there will also be more jobs, but again, I cannot publicly discuss job or employer details. So I would have to leave a lot out here anyway.
