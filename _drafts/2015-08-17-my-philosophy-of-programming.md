## The Difference Between a Good Programmer and a Great One

As with anything in life, if we do something we want to do our best. Sometimes achieving our best potential is simply a matter of skill and other times, less apparently, mindset plays a role in allowing us to move beyond being just *good* and being truely *great*. Mindset is what will keep you going when you're tired, when you want to give up. This is in my opinion an essential truth which must be realized by programmers. Programming requires more than just knowledge or a certain skillset -- it also takes, as Travis Neilson describes it: "Grit, Perserverance, and ..." [check sourse].


## Skill != Greatness

Technical knowledge and skill are no doubt essential tools of a programmer, but that is really all they are -- tools. Merely knowing a programming language, no matter how well, will not nessisarily lead to being a great programmer (or even a good one for that matter). For example, there are thousands and millions of technically skilled musicians who can play any piece of music put in front of them. However, how often are they considered great musicians? Especially compared to widely-regarded great artists like John Lennon, Paul McCarteney, Mick Jagger, Frederique Chopin (sorry to get classical on you)[check names]. In that analogy it becomes apparent that greatness cannot not be soley attributed to skill.
