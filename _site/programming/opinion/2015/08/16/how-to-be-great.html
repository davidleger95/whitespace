            <h2 class="post-title">How to be a Great Programmer</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="post-body">
            <p>There&#39;s more to being a great programmer than just knowing how to write code. Problem solving is a big part of what makes a great programmer truely <em>great</em>. The concept of problem solving is implicitly taught in computer science courses but it is generally left up to students to develop the essential skills without guidance from intructors.</p>

<p>Problem solving can be a difficult skill to teach. By it&#39;s very definition, it is intangible. What makes a good solution? The exact answer to this question varies greatly depending on the problem being solved. However, the essential approach to developing solutions to problems remains relatively the same no matter what the problem is.</p>

<p>Just as a novel has an introduction, initiating incident, rising action, climax, falling action, and conclution -- I like to think of problems I&#39;m faced with in a similar way. Solving a problem is like writing a novel: it requires brainstorming, trial and error, and a creative bend.</p>

<h2>You Can&#39;t Code Everything!</h2>

<p>When all you have is a hammer, everything problem a nail. Likewise when you only know how to code, you&#39;ll only think of solutions involving code. Sometimes code is one solution, but there may be a faster, more efficient, or even better solution using a different approach. Even as programmers, we must consider the possibility that writing code is not always the best solution. To better explain what I mean by this let me use an example of something that happened to me. </p>

<p>While I was working at <a href="http://www.marinerinnovation.com">Mariner Innovations</a> last year (for non-disclosure I&#39;ll leave out some details), something happened that made me realize I was looking at every problem through an incredibly narrow scope.</p>

<p>One day while working on my main project, which involved parsing plain text files, my supervisor sent me an email asking if I could take a table of batch jobs which was stored in a MS Word file and make a CSV file containing certain information about each job and excluding other pieces of information. Since the project I had been working on for several months created CSV files through an automated script, I assumed he wanted something similar for these batch jobs. So I spent the whole day writing a Java command line tool to parse through this MS Word file -- which was no piece of cake, if you&#39;ve ever seen the plain-text format of a MS Word table. At some point in the afternoon, I had the parser almost working flawlessly, and my supervisor came over and asked if I was done with the batch file yet. At this point I found out that converting the batch jobs from the MS Word document to CSV was a one-time thing.</p>

<p>So what can we learn from this? First, make sure you are always 100% sure about what your requirements are before even thinking about a solution. Second, and more relevant to this article, writing code is not always the best solution to a problem. Although the programming solution I developed for this problem did eventually work, it was not the best solution; it was incredibly time-consuming, and still somewhat buggy. A much better solution would have been to copy the data from the table into MS Excel, remove the unwanted data, and export to CSV. This solution is an improvement from the command line tool I had written in every aspect: it drastically reduces time to a solution, and eliminates the potential for bugs.</p>

<h2>...But You&#39;re Going to Code Most Things</h2>

<p>Although the example above is one where code was not a solution, there are still plenty of strictly programming problems where considering all possible solutions remains especially difficult. So now the question is: How do we broaden our scope of potential solutions in order to find the best one? In the example I used above, it seems pretty simple: just think about the problem more thoroughly. This is true, but to truely consider all possible solutions to any given problem, we must do more than just <em>think harder</em>. Throughout my experience, I&#39;ve discovered that improving one&#39;s problem solving abilities can be achieved through two things:</p>

<p>One is having knowledge in a variety of areas outside of programming. Even if it seems completely unrelated, it may someday help in solving a problem. One of my professors, <a href="">Rick Wightman</a> told me that he did a survey of students to see what courses in high school corelated most heavily with success in computer science and he found that English and theatre arts were the top two. // needs elaboration</p>

<p>[Abstract thinking can shatter barriers you didn&#39;t even know were there]()</p>

<p>Two is abstract thinking. Abstract thinking can shatter barriers you didn&#39;t even know were there and lead to solutions that were otherwise impossible. /* needs a transition */ This is important because in order for knowledge to be useful, we must be able to think of ways it can apply in different situations. Take English language arts, for example. The reason I believe English correlates so well with success in computer science is because they both share a common thread -- language. If you&#39;re an Enlish major, there is no doubt you know the correct usage of punctuation such as colons, semi-colon, and commas. Futhermore, you would know complex grammar rules and likely have a large vocabulary. Just as in English, computer languages also rely on grammar, punctuation, spelling, and the especially vocabulary since <a href="">naming is one of the hardest concepts in computer science</a>.</p>

<p>// 3. knowing many languages and technologies and their pros and cons in different situations</p>

<h2>Final Words</h2>

<p>A great programmer approaches challenges with all perspectives in mind, even non-programming perspectives. I like to think this concept is also applicable to most things in life. The more knowledge you have, you clearer your view of reality; and the clearer your view of reality, the more potential you have to learn new things.</p>

<p>Just remember to always</p>
