**PREVIOUS PART:** [Applying for Internships (Part 4): Designing a Long-Form Resume]({{page.previous.url}})

The cover letter and the business card are both points of entry for the audience of my job application package. Their purpose is to briefly express my personal brand and direct the people to more detailed content. 

Where these two compontents of my job application package differ, is in length and context. A business card is small and portable, and is usually presented in a stand-alone context. I decided to make my card portrait instead of the traditional landscape orientation because it will help differentiate my card from others. I also group my contact information by direct contact, and third-party profiles, and then ordered them by significance. I want to direct people to my website first rather than emailing me directly because I want to avoid having people call me or sending me emails without first knowing who I am. This will avoid redundant questions that my website already answers, like: "What areas of work are you interesting in?" and "What sort of work experience do you have?". I want people who contact me to be informed before they do so.

A cover letter is no doubt longer than a business card and as opposed to being stand-alone, it is usually accompanied by a resume (either single-page, long-form, or both). It also has the opposite implication of a business card. A business card is passive and just provides information as an optional call-to-action. A cover letter is a bit more forward; it provokes action by the reader. It may direct the reader to to an item an attached resume or call for a response from the reader. For the cover letter I decided to just make a template and later I will write unique cover letters for each individual job I apply for.

## What's Next?

The next piece of the puzzle will be outlining attributes and designing a template for case studies. A case study is detailed analysis of projects I've done. These are valuable in providing insight to employers and clients about processes I use in my work.
