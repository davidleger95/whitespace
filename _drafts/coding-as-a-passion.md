#  Creating Quality Programmers

Code surrounds us. It’s everywhere. Even this article was written in code and refactored many times over before reaching you. It began as a markdown file, then it was fed into the Jekyll compiler that builds my website’s HTML pages, and now it’s being rendered by your web browser for your viewing.

This  — my connection to you — was all made possible by code. And that code was written by programmers. That is something that often goes unappreciated. 

## The *How* is the Everywhere, but the *Why* is More Important

What I want to address first is the ***why*** behind programming that is often lost when addressing the ***how*** of programming in a learning environment.

> A quality programmer sees problems from all perspective, not just programming.

You can go online and Google how to do X in language Y and get hundreads of YouTube tutorials and Stack Overflow threads with the correct answer, but there are far fewer answers, but still some, when trying to figure out why you should even begin to learn to code in the first place. Still, most of what you’ll find on the topic are articles highlighting the surplus of jobs in the industry. OK. That answers the question of job availability and compensation. But what does the promise of a well-paying job get employers? What you end up with is a hoard of semi-interested computer scientist who don’t get it, who aren’t passionate. But what would be better: quantity or quality? There is a trade-off and I believe quality is the way to go. So now the question is: How do we recruit quality programmers? 

## What is a Quality Programmer?

First, what is a quality programmer? Here are just a few attributes I consider a quality programmer to have:

 - A quality programmer sweats the details.
 - A quality programmer is passionate about their work regardless of compensation.
 - A quality programmer is always learning.
 - A quality programmer strives for professionalism.
 - A quality programmer finishes projects not only on time, but ahead of schedule.
 - A quality programmer understands the importance of having a well-defined problem.
 - A quality programmer sees problems from all perspective, not just as a programmer and understands that a coded solution may not neccisarily be the best solution.
 - A quality programmer understands the importance of communication.

This list is by no means all inclusive (leave a comment, what would you add to the list?), but at least we now have a baseline critera for a quality programmer. 

Notice how I didn’t include anything related to job prospects or salary in the list. In fact, I implied the opposite: that salary should not matter to a quality programmer in my second point. However, this does not mean employers should be allowed to take advantage of a quality programmer and give them slave wages. It simply means that the quality of work is not dependant on salary or other forms of compensation. For example, if a quality programmer is doing a project pro bono, it will be indistinguishable from work for which they recieved payment.

So if salary is irrelavant to a quality programmer, then why are employers promoting careers in computer science based on the promise of good compensation (including [circus-like workplaces](http://www.google.ca/about/careers/lifeatgoogle/inside-google-a-look-at-its-nyc-office.html))? I think this is a result of the desperation to fill positions. But the problem with promoting programming in this way is it creates a duality between people’s enthusiasm and passion for their work and the compensation employers can offer. And also, people who are not interested in their work, but more so in their compensation.

## Code is Poetry

A better way to promote computer science is to reframe programming as a form of artistic experssion rather than just a career path. This does two things: One, it attracts people who are passionate. How? Poets are passionate. Musicians are passionate. Movie directors are passionate. They persue these career paths because they are passionate. These careers allow them to create and influence the things and people around them. And programming is creative, it is influencial. Code is poetry. It’s about time people knew.

> A quality programmer will know more, work with vigorous passion, and constantly be creating by default.

The second thing this reframing of programming accomplishes is it eliminates the desperation employers have for filling jobs. A quality programmer will provide intangible value beyond that of several programmers who view their work as just that — work — because a quality programmer will know more, work with vigorous passion, and constantly be creating by default.
