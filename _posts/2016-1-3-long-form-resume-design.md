**PREVIOUS PART:** [Applying for Internships (Part 3): Designing a Single-Page Resume]({{page.previous.url}})

Picking up where I left off in the previous part, this time I designed my long-form resume. Although the single page resume is great for emplyers to get a quick glimpse of my skills, interests, and experience, it doesn't give much context. So the long-form resume is for employers who might want to learn a little bit more about a particular item on my resume.

<object data="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/files/long-form-resume-draft.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="100%" style="position: relative; max-width: 740px; min-height:600px; margin: auto; display: block; box-shadow: 0 0 5px rgba(0,0,0, 0.5)"></object>

I'm still in the job application package design stage of this project. There were some minor setbacks in part 3 which has extended my timeline by a couple days. Also, setting the timeline before the deliverables were defined was a bad idea. How could I have been able to set a timeline without deliverables? It makes perfect sense now that I think about it, but sometimes with larger-scale projects, some small but important things get neglected. It's all part of the learning experinece though and something to keep in mind for my next project.

In the next part, I'll be designing the standard business card, and a cover letter components for the job application package.
