## Introduction

This being the first of (hopefully) many articles, I decided to tackle a more general topic that is one of the reasons I decided to start whitespace. That is education.

Everyone goes through the public school system. It's just something you gotta do. And as with all thing mandatory people -- myself included -- complain about it. So the word education often has the negative connotation of being *boring* or *stressful*.

## The Narrow Scope of Public Education

Having gone through public schools myself, I fell victim to the idea that school was education and education was school. But I discovered that this was a huge misconception and that everyone I knew also fell victim to the false equality.

What I eventually realized was that school is just one small part of what I consider to be my education. Once I realized this, my mind opened up. I was free -- free to learn what I wanted to learn.

The catalyst for this realization came to me when I first started to write code. The first time I ever wrote a code was when I was in grade ten. It was a simple webpage for my Broad-Based Technology (BBT) class in high school. To give some context, BBT was part of a group of courses called *Specialties* which included Visual Art, Music, and Phys. Ed.; each of which lasted for a mere half-semester. BBT was usually (cross-out) always a joke of a class. The curriculum was ten to fiften years out of date and the teacher, who doubled as the schools tech support guy, did not give a shit about student success. It was a downright depressing class.
 
So while sitting there staring at this clunky old computer, typing out my first HTML website, I had a spark of inspiration. "What if I changed the font?" I thought to myself. (I never like Times New Roman much.) A quick Google search of "how to change fonts in html" introduced me to CSS (a description language for adding styles to HTML pages). A little while longer on Google lead me to realize that the entire curriculum for the web development unit was extremly outdated. It was then that I decided to start learning how to code.

From this point on, I began to question the quality of the rest of my education as well. English, history, math -- I began to rethink what their purpose was in my education as a whole. Why are we being taught all these things? What is the end goal?

## Classical Education

The public school system does a lot of good. It accomplishes the task it is designed to do. It's main task being to educate the general public on a basic level by the time they reach adulthood. It is nothing more than a baseline for functioning as a citizen. The education system teaches basic concepts in math, science, language, history, and (inheritly) social interaction. These are expected of everyone as a bare minimum in today's society.

When thinking about public education in this broader context, it becomes apparent that your education is not primarily for your benefit, but rather for the benefit of society. You are expected to have a certain level of competence. Your education is an investment by your community with an expected positive return through, for example, joining the workforce to stimulate economic growth.

Public school is nowhere near the gold standard in education. It is too unfocused to teach readily applicable skills. Graduating high school is merely a benchmark for entering society. Public education does however provide the basis needed to further your education.

The next step in the classical education track in college or university. This level of education is more focused yet it is still too general to be directly applicable to a job. You still have the same measures you did back in public school of assignments, tests, and grades, which do not exist in the real world. At a real job, if you show your boss some work and it is only about 75% complete by the due date because you didn't know how to do part of it, you don't get a B+. The reality is that the work is unfinished and still has to be done -- now.
