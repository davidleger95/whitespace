## What is whitespace?

whitespace is a blog about the art of web design and development. It is based on the idea that software design and development is as much an art as it is a technical skill.

> "Technology alone is not enough. Itâ€™s technology married with the liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the results that make our hearts sing." -Steve Jobs
