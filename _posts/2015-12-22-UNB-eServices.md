In week four of Designber, I continued the trend from last week by redesigning UNB eServices. eServices has many use cases so I decided to narrow my scope and focus on just a single aspect of the application, which is Term Marks. I chose to focus on this part of eServices because it is the most widely used.

You'll also notice that I left a lot of tabs out of the new design. This was not by accident. I chose to do this because most of those tabs could be condensed into one of three categories: Academic, Finalcial, and Personal.

## Current Design of eServices

The current design isn't that bad, it's just outdated. It was a good design when it was built over ten years ago, but the web has progressed immensely since then...

## My Failed Redesign

When I first started the redesign, I wanted it to have a minimalist look and feel, but this didn't work out. What I ended up with was a cluttered, uncoordinated design. And this is when I stopped.

## My Second Attempt

I came back to the design with all the failures of my first attempt in mind. This helped me avoid the pitfalls of my first design and I was finally able to create something I liked.
