**PREVIOUS PART:** [Applying for Internships (Part 5): Designing a Cover Letter & Business Card]({{page.previous.url}})

Case studies are incredibly powerful assets to have when applying for jobs or looking for client work. A case study tells a story, from inception to completion, of work you've done in the past. They give potential employers and clients insight into your process and strategy for solving problems. It shows prospective employers and clients the value you are capable of providing to their own projects by seeing exactly how you work.

I often hear people say that I, as a web developer, have it easy when applying for jobs because I can show off my work publicly on the web. This is true, websites are incredibly more accessible than, for example, work done by an accountant to balance a budget. What people often don't realize is that case studies can be made publicly accessible on the web as well, and that case studies are almost limitless in the types of projects for which they can be used. The example of the accountant balancing a budget can be refactored into a case study just as easily as any web-based project. Even with web-based projects, case studies can still provide valuable details about your work that are not immediately perceivable at face value.

Below is the first case study I developed for one of my freelance projects with the University of New Brunswick. As I create more case studies, I will refine the template more and more. So for now, this is a first draft of what will be the final product. I would love to hear and comments or suggestions you may have about this case study.

## What's Next?

Now that I have the template for the case study complete, I want to move on the redesiging and recode my personal website. This is arguably the most important piece of the job application package because it will be the piece which binds all the other components together.
