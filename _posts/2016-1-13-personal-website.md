The current version of my personal website has been up since August 2015, and before that I launched the first version of my personal website in May 2015. So this is the third major redesign I've done of my personal website in the past year. Why do I keep redesigning it? Why not just design it once and stick with it? Well, my skills and abilities are constantly improving and I want my personal website to reflect that skill level. I always look at my previous work and think, "I can do better." And so I do. It's a good thing to be able to think critically about past work, it's the only way we can improve.

Just for context, here are v1 and v2 of my personal website:

## The New Design

As this redesign of my personal website will be part of my job application package, I used the same syle I've been using thus far for the other components. When finished, my personal website will act as a central location, binding all the other components of my job application package together. I also plan to integrate Whitespace with my personal brand a bit more. So keeping these things in mind, I designed v3 of my personal website.

The next step now is to implement this design with code.
