For those of you who don't know, CSS (Cascading Stylesheets) is language for styleing HTML elements. For the longest time, developers used pure CSS in projects. However, as the need for websites to be more and more stylized grew, CSS documents became unmanagable for several reasons.

    1. No variable declaration. The problem with this is if, for example, you have a color scheme of yellow and purple and you want to change yellow to grey everywhere on the site, you would have to go through the entire document and manually change each instance of the color.
    2. No nesting. The lack of nesting means a lot of code has to be repeated. Selectors have to be rewritten. Again this decreases maintainablility 
    3. No polymorphism (abstraction). Oftentimes, elements such as buttons, inputs, etc. will have some shared styles with the sole difference being color, size, etc... Without an simple way to define shared styles, a lot of repeated code appears in each variation of the element.
    
There are a few other issues but these are the ones I've run into most often when dealing with pure CSS.

These problems are all adressed with the emergance of CSS preprocessors like LESS, , and SASS (which we're going to take a look at today). A preprocessor is a tool used to compile code written in one language into another language. In the case of CSS preprocessors, the output language is CSS. This is necessary because web browsers will only render pure CSS. I like using SASS over other preprocessors because its syntax is very similar to pure CSS and even more similar wwith SASS's SCSS syntax (which I use for all my projects).

My goal with this exercise is to test the limits of the SASS language by doing some math operations. I often use Python for writing algorithms so I decided to use the SASS syntax (rather than SCSS) because it's similar to Python syntax.

Now, just in case you're not familiar with CSS and SASS, I want to point out that what I'm attenpting to do here is incredably unconventional and it is NEVER EVER to be done in practice. This is only of an exercise in curiosity to see what is possible with SASS. If you want to do this correctly, use a language meant for doing math like Python, MATLAB, or R.

So let's get started!

## Setting Up the View

I wanted to leave the HTML document as bare as possible and move the content into SASS. So I only included a `head` element to import the stylesheet with the `link` element and and a `body` element to attach the data. (The `title` element is just for asthetics.)

``` html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Sass Math</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">
    </head>
    <body></body>
</html>

```

Now before we start adding logic, I fisrt want to give the DOM some styles (we are using stylesheets afterall) and bind the varibles that will eventually contain the results of our math.

``` sass

$input:     Input
$result:    Result

// Display the contents of head and title
head
    display: block
    title
        display: block
        margin-top: 20px
        
        color: #eee
        text-align: center
        font-family: Palatino
        font-style: italic
        font-size: 60px
        text-shadow: 5px 5px 5px #000
        
        &:after
            display: block
            margin-top: 30px
            
            font-family: menlo
            font-style: normal
            font-size: 0.4em
            letter-spacing: 0px
            text-shadow: none
        
            content: "whitespace"

// Define styles for the body
body 
    padding-top: 100px
    background: #4a4a4a

    color: white
    text-align: center
    font-family: menlo
    font-style: italic
    
    &:before
        display: block
        font-size: 30px
        content: "#{$input}"
    &:after
        display: inline-block
        margin: 1em 0
        padding: 20px
        border-radius: 80px
        background: #eee
        box-shadow: 0 0 20px #fff

        color: purple
        font-size: 40px

        content: "#{$result}"
        
```

So for the head, I decided to display it's content and bind the whitespace name to it just to add some extra fill to the view without adding to the HTML document.

I was able to to bind my Input and Result text to the body tag by using the shadow DOM's :before and :after selectors with have the option to add a style called `content` which can contain a string of a number value. This value is then appended to the top and bottom of the `body` element.

Now that everything is setup, we can start to do math within SASS.

## Sums

Summing is a pretty basic concept. So let's start with that. We'll sum the numbers 1 though 10.

*(Since I've already shown the styles code above, I'm going to omit unchanging code from these blocks)*

``` sass
// Summing integers 1 through 10



```

## Factorials

``` sass
// Multiplying numbers 1 through 10



```

## Exponents

For exponents, I will try 2<sup>8</sup>.

Exponentials are a bit more of a challenge since SASS doesn't natively support them. So now we have to define a function which will build the exponant operator for us. Once our function is built, we can call it to evaluate exponentials for us.

``` sass
// Evaluating 2^8



```

## Sorting

``` sass
// Sorting the list [5,2,6,4,2,8,1,5,12,3] in ascending order



```


## Root of a Function

Now for the real test... 

Finding the root of a function seems like a pretty simple task, but for a computer, it involves complex algorithms. The one I will be implementing here is called the [bisection method](). It starts with an interval where f(x1) is less than 0 and f(x2) is greater than 0, leaving the root somewhere in between. The computer then finds the middle of these two points and checks if the result is 0 (the root). If it is not the root, the original interval is narrowed to include the midpoint and one of the two original points (x1 or x2, whichever one has the opposite sign of the midpoint). The process is then repeated.

Here's a flowchart that explains the bisection method:

This was a tough one but I managed to get it working! The only limitation is that CSS is limited to five decimal places. So the result is not as accurate as I would like it to be.
