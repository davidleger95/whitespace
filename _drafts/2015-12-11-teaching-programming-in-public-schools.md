Computers have now become an essential part of our culture. Most of us rely on computers daily to do work, entertain ourself, and communicate with others. So why is it that, with a field as essential as computer science, no one knows how to code?

Some people may argue that only programmers should be taught how to write code. I mean, really, what's the average person going to do with the skill of programming? If this is the case, then why not leave skills in mathimatics to the mathmaticians, and writing skills to the writers. Most people don't write essays at their jobs, or find the hypotenuse of a trianle. Why bother learning these skills at all?

Now of course this is absurd. 

Most people will agree that language and math skills are at the core of anyone's education, regardless of their utility in various careers. The same case can be made for computer programming. Computer programming is not just about learning to write code; it's about problem solving, logical thinking, both math (algorithms) and grammar (programming language syntax), and much more. Steve Jobs once said: "Everyone should learn how to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think!" 

## The Curent Curriculum

In the current high school curriculum in New Brunswick, programming is barely even mentioned. The closest thing to programming that everyone is exposed to is tech class. Tech courses in high schools are often outdated and underrepresented. Let me first discuss the context in which tech class exists in most New Brunswick schools. Tech is lumped into a group of courses called *specialities*. Specialities, alongside Tech, also include Visual Art, Music, and Physical Education. These courses are meant to be taught as hobbies -- not careers. So the context in which Tech is presented to student is very influential to how it is precieved by students. It gives students the preception that *this is fun... but not something that I would do as a career.* Which is incredibly detrimental to the field of programming. Very few people will find success as a professional musician, fewer as a professional athelete (Phys. Ed.), and professional painters are even sparser. So naturally, computer science is the same, right? Wrong. I mean, chances are you won't be the next Mark Zuckerburg or Bill Gates, but with an average salary above 100K per year, there certainly are very few starving programmers. So for Tech class to have the same level of importance as these other specialties is simply misleading. Some schools in New Brunswick do offer computer science as an elective, but it is not a science elective the same as physics, chemistry, and biology.


## How to Implement Programming in Schools

When I was learning math in high school, I had no idea that I would be using those skills today. I simply was not told how Functions and Relations (Math level 112), or Trig and 3-Space (Math level 120) could apply in a career setting. When I started to write code, I realized that functions, matricies, sets, everything that I was learning in high school math that I thought was pointless finally had utility.

This is where I think programming would be best integrated into the New Brunswick high school curriculum. The course content of Functions and Relations (a mandatory course) would remain relatively the same but slightly modified to be taught through programming basics. More complexity would be introduced in Trig and 3-Space (non-mandatory), through the use of multi-dimentional arrays (matricies).

## What Language Should be Taught

Some may disagree with my opinion on this, but I think the choice of language is abundantly clear. I would propose teaching with Python. I think Python would be best for several reasons:

### 1. English-like syntax.

Python's syntax is very lightweight, unlike C-based languages like Java, C#, C++. It uses strightforward semantics that can be easily interpreted by people who are new to programming. Variables do not need to be defined before being used and they are implicitly typed, which emliminates the need to introduce students to variable definition and typing concepts. To wrap up this point nicely, Python abstracts everything that is unnecessary and just lets you write naturally. Python code can essentially be read as a statement English without much conffusion. Bsic math syntax already teaches students most of the syntax used in Python. What's left are conditionals and iterators, which could be covered end-to-end in a couple days.

### 2. Widely used in a variety of software products.

Python is in my opinion the new Java. Thoase familiar with Java know that it is the Swiss Army knife of programming languages. You can build Android apps, websites, games, command line tools, graphical user interfaces, language parsers, and more, all with Java. However, the drawbacks to Java are that it is verbose. A lot of Java code has to be written before it will do anything which makes programming slow and tiring. Python on the other hand, is incredably lightweight and has most of the capabilities of Java.
